# Estimation-Of-Treatment-Effect-With-Causal-Inference
Estimation of a treatment effect on head trauma patients with matching methods for Paris Hospital (AP-HP). We used coarsened exact matching, propensity matching (logistic regression, random forest, backward AIC) and cardinality matching on the Traumabase raw dataset (10k Ã— 50). We also tested the robustness of our method towards missing value completion and FAMD which were two techniques we used to preprocess the data.

Here is the code we used for our project:

Mains:

* simulation.rmd is the file to use for running the simulation to compare different matching methods on synthetic data. 

* traumabase.rmd is the file to use to preprocess the traumabase in order to use the matching methods (and bootstrapping) to estimate the causal effect.

Auxiliary Functions:

*amputation.R is the code from https://rmisstastic.netlify.com/how-to/generate/misssimul used to generate missing values in data

* DataGeneration.R is the code used to generate our 9 scenarios, each corresponding to a distribution of data. Parameters (means, variance) are hardcoded here.

* globalSimulation is the code used to run the simulation given as input the scenario chosen and the number of simulation

* matchingFunctions.R are the matching algorithms to use for synthetic data. It contains coarsened exact matching, propensity matching (logistic regression, random forest, backward AIC)

* matchingFunctionsTraumabase.r are the matching algorithms to use for the traumabase. It contains coarsened exact matching, propensity matching (logistic regression, random forest, backward AIC)

* missingValSimulation.R is the code used to generate our 9 scenarios with missing values, that can be generated and imputed in different ways.

* plotFunctions.R is the code used to plot ATT and difference in mean for the simulations
